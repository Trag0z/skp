</B></P>

<P>All C++ library entities are declared or defined in one or more
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_headers">standard headers</A>.
To make use of a library entity in a program, write an
<A HREF="preproc.html#include_directive"><I>include</I> directive</A>
that names the relevant standard header.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Using_C++_Library_Headers"></A>Using C++ Library Headers</H2>

<P>You include the contents of a standard header by naming it in an
<A HREF="preproc.html#include_directive"><I>include</I> directive</A>,
as in:</P>

<PRE>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  /* include I/O facilities */</PRE>

<P>You can include the standard headers in any order, a standard
header more than once, or two or more standard headers that define
the same macro or the same type.
Do not include a standard header within a declaration. Do not
define macros that have the same names as keywords before you include
a standard header.</P>

<P>A C++ library header includes any other C++ library headers
it needs to define needed types. (Always include explicitly any
C++ library headers needed in a translation unit, however, lest
you guess wrong about its actual dependencies.) A Standard C header
never includes another standard header. A standard header declares
or defines only the entities described for it in this document.</P>

<P>Every function in the library is declared in a standard header.
Unlike in Standard C, the standard header never provides a
<A HREF="lib_over.html#masking_macro">masking macro</A>,
with the same name as the function, that masks the function
declaration and achieves the same effect.</P>

<P>All names other than <CODE>operator delete</CODE> and
<CODE>operator new</CODE> in the C++ library headers are defined in the
<B><CODE><A NAME="std_namespace"></A>std</CODE></B> namespace,
or in a namespace nested within the <CODE>std</CODE> namespace.
You refer to the name
<CODE><A HREF="iostream.html#cin">cin</A></CODE>, for example,
as <CODE>std::cin</CODE>. Note, however, that macro names are not subject to
namespace qualification, so you always write
<CODE><A HREF="complex.html#__STD_COMPLEX">__STD_COMPLEX</A></CODE>
without a namespace qualifier.</P>

<P>In some translation environments, including a C++ library header
may hoist external names declared in the <CODE>std</CODE> namespace
into the global namespace as well, with individual <I>using</I>
declarations for each of the names. Otherwise, the header does
<I>not</I> introduce any library names into the current namespace.</P>

<P>The C++ Standard requires that the
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_headers">C Standard headers</A> declare
all external names in namespace <CODE>std</CODE>, then hoist them into
the global namespace with individual <I>using</I> declarations
for each of the names.
But in some translation environments the C Standard headers
include no namespace declarations,
declaring all names directly in the global namespace.
Thus, the most portable way to deal with namespaces is to follow
two rules:</P>

<UL>
<LI>To assuredly declare in namespace <CODE>std</CODE>
an external name that is traditionally declared
in <CODE>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</CODE>, for example,
include the header <CODE>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</CODE>. Know that
the name might also be declared in the global namespace.</LI>

<LI>To assuredly declare in the global namespace
an external name declared in <CODE>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</CODE>,
include the header <CODE>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</CODE> directly. Know that
the name might also be declared in namespace <CODE>std</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Thus, if you want to call
<CODE>std::<A HREF="stdlib.html#abort">abort</A>()</CODE>
to cause abnormal termination,
you should include <CODE>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</CODE>.
And if you want to call <CODE>abort()</CODE>,
you should include
<CODE>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</CODE>.</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can write the declaration:</P>

<PRE>using namespace std;</PRE>

<P>which assuredly hoists all library names into the current namespace.
If you write this declaration immediately after all <I>include</I>
directives, you hoist the names into the global namespace.
You can subsequently ignore namespace
considerations in the remainder of the translation unit.
You also avoid most dialect differences across different
translation environments.</P>

<P>Unless specifically indicated otherwise, you may not define names in
the <CODE>std</CODE> namespace, or in a namespace nested within the
<CODE>std</CODE> namespace.</P>

<H2><A NAME="C++_Library_Conventions"></A>C++ Library Conventions</H2>

<P>The C++ library obeys much the same
<A HREF="lib_over.html#C_Library_Conventions">conventions</A>
as the Standard C library, plus a few more outlined here.</P>

<P>An implementation has certain latitude in how it declares types
and functions in the C++ library:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Names of functions in the Standard C library may have either
<B><A NAME="extern_&quot;C++&quot;"></A><CODE>extern "C++"</CODE></B> or
<B><A NAME="extern_&quot;C&quot;"></A><CODE>extern "C"</CODE></B> linkage.
Include the appropriate
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_headers">Standard C header</A>
rather than declare a library entity inline.</LI>

<LI>A member function name in a library class may have additional
function signatures over those listed in this document. You can
be sure that a function call described here behaves as expected,
but you cannot reliably take the address of a library member function.
(The type may not be what you expect.)</LI>

<LI>A library class may have undocumented (non-virtual) base classes.
A class documented as derived from another class may, in fact,
be derived from that class through other undocumented classes.</LI>

<LI>A type defined as a synonym for some integer type may be the
same as one of several different integer types.</LI>

<LI>A <B><A NAME="bitmask_type"></A>bitmask type</B> can
be implemented as either an integer type or an enumeration.
In either case, you can perform bitwise operations (such as AND
and OR) on values of the same bitmask type. The <I>elements</I>
<CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE> of a bitmask type are nonzero
values such that <CODE>A &amp; B</CODE> is zero.
Beginning with <B>C++11</B>, the bitwise operations are declared as
<CODE>constexpr</CODE> to signal that they are treated as
compile-time constants.</LI>

<LI>A library function that has no exception specification can
throw an arbitrary exception, unless its definition clearly
restricts such a possibility.</LI>
</UL>

<P>On the other hand, there are some restrictions you can count on:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The Standard C library uses no
<A HREF="lib_over.html#masking_macro">masking macros</A>. Only specific function
signatures are reserved, not the names of the functions themselves.</LI>

<LI>A library function name outside a class will <I>not</I> have
additional, undocumented, function signatures. You can reliably
take its address.</LI>

<LI>Base classes and member functions described as virtual are
assuredly virtual, while those described as non-virtual are
assuredly non-virtual.</LI>

<LI>Two types defined by the C++ library
are always different unless this document explicitly suggests
otherwise.</LI>

<LI>Functions supplied by the library, including the default versions of
<A HREF="new.html#replaceable_functions">replaceable functions</A>,
can throw <I>at most</I> those exceptions listed in any exception
specification.
No destructors supplied by the library throw exceptions.
Functions in the
<A HREF="index.html#Standard_C_Library">Standard C library</A>
may propagate an exception, as when
<CODE><A HREF="stdlib.html#qsort">qsort</A></CODE> calls a comparison
function that throws an exception, but they do not otherwise throw
exceptions.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="iostreams"></A>Iostreams Conventions</H2>

<P>The <B>iostreams</B> headers support conversions
between text and encoded forms, and input and output to external
<A HREF="lib_file.html#files">files</A>:
<CODE><A HREF="fstream.html">&lt;fstream&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="iomanip.html">&lt;iomanip&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="ios.html">&lt;ios&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="iosfwd.html">&lt;iosfwd&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="iostream.html">&lt;iostream&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="istream.html">&lt;istream&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="ostream.html">&lt;ostream&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="sstream.html">&lt;sstream&gt;</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="streambu.html">&lt;streambuf&gt;</A></CODE>, and
<CODE><A HREF="strstrea.html">&lt;strstream&gt;</A></CODE>.</P>

<P>The simplest use of iostreams requires only that you include
the header <CODE>&lt;iostream&gt;</CODE>. You can then extract values from
<A HREF="iostream.html#cin"><CODE>cin</CODE></A>, to read the
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_input">standard input</A>.
The rules for doing so are outlined in the description of the class
<CODE><A HREF="istream.html#basic_istream">basic_istream</A></CODE>.
You can also insert values to
<A HREF="iostream.html#cout"><CODE>cout</CODE></A>, to write the
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_output">standard output</A>.
The rules for doing so are outlined in the description of the class
<CODE><A HREF="ostream.html#basic_ostream">basic_ostream</A></CODE>.
Format control common to both extractors and insertors is managed
by the class <CODE><A HREF="ios.html#basic_ios">basic_ios</A></CODE>.
Manipulating this format information in the guise of extracting and
inserting objects is the province of several
<A HREF="iomanip.html">manipulators</A>.</P>

<P>You can perform the same iostreams operations on files that you
open by name, using the classes declared in
<CODE>&lt;fstream&gt;</CODE>.
To convert between iostreams and objects of class
<CODE><A HREF="string2.html#basic_string">basic_string</A></CODE>,
use the classes declared in <CODE>&lt;sstream&gt;</CODE>.
And to do the same with <A HREF="lib_over.html#C_string">C strings</A>,
use the classes declared in <CODE>&lt;strstream&gt;</CODE>.</P>

<P>The remaining headers provide support services, typically of direct
interest to only the most advanced users of the iostreams classes.</P>

<H2><A NAME="C++_Program_Startup_and_Termination"></A>C++ Program Startup and Termination</H2>

<P>A C++ program performs the same operations as does a C program
<A HREF="lib_over.html#program_startup">program startup</A> and at
<A HREF="lib_over.html#program_termination">program termination</A>,
plus a few more outlined here.</P>

<P>Before the target environment calls the function
<A HREF="lib_over.html#main"><CODE>main</CODE></A>, and after it stores
any constant initial values you specify in all objects that have
static duration, the program executes any remaining constructors
for such static objects. The order of execution is not specified
between translation units, but you can nevertheless assume that some
<A HREF="#iostreams">iostreams</A> objects are properly initialized
for use by these static constructors. These control
text streams:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="iostream.html#cin"><CODE>cin</CODE></A></B> --
for <A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_input">standard input</A></LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="iostream.html#cout"><CODE>cout</CODE></A></B> --
for <A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_output">standard output</A></LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="iostream.html#cerr"><CODE>cerr</CODE></A></B> --
for unbuffered
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_error">standard error</A> output</LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="iostream.html#clog"><CODE>clog</CODE></A></B> --
for buffered
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard_error">standard error</A> output</LI>
</UL>

<P>You can also use these objects within the destructors called for
static objects, during
<A HREF="lib_over.html#program_termination">program termination</A>.</P>

<P>As with C, returning
from <A HREF="lib_over.html#main"><CODE>main</CODE></A> or calling
<A HREF="stdlib.html#exit"><CODE>exit</CODE></A>
calls all functions registered with
<A HREF="stdlib.html#atexit"><CODE>atexit</CODE></A>
in reverse order of registry.
An exception thrown from such a registered function calls
<CODE><A HREF="exceptio.html#terminate">terminate</A>()</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="C++11"></A>C++11 Additions</H2>

<P>(Note: None of the features added with C++11 are a part of EC++.)</P>

<P>A number of new features are added with <B>C++11</B>, a revision of the C++ Standard. They are labeled as such throughout this document.
Some features that are of particular interest:</P>

<P>A parameter of type
<CODE><A NAME="initializer_list"></A>initializer_list</CODE>
takes a brace-enclosed initializer list as its corresponding argument.
It behaves just like a sequence of elements of type <CODE>Ty</CODE>.</P>

<P>An <B><A NAME="rvalue_references"></A>rvalue reference</B> is indicated
by <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> in a context where you can write <CODE>&amp;</CODE>
to indicate a reference. As a function parameter, an rvalue reference
matches only an argument that is
<B><A NAME="movable"></A>movable</B> --
it will assuredly be destroyed at the end of the function-call expression,
or the program promises that it will be destroyed before any further use.
Hence, the function can commandeer data owned
by the argument, thus <B>moving</B> data instead of <B>copying</B> it,
so long as the resultant argument can be properly destroyed.
(A function overload with an rvalue reference of the form
<CODE>T&amp;&amp;</CODE> typically accompanies an older function
overload with a corresponding const reference of the form
<CODE>const T&amp;</CODE>. The former can alter the (temporary) object,
while the latter promises to leave the object unaltered.</P>

<P>Similarly, objects of some types can be
<B><A NAME="swappable"></A>swappable</B> even if they cannot be
copied or assigned.</P>

<P>A <B><A NAME="variadic_templates"></A>variadic template</B> includes
template parameters with ellipsis (<CODE>...</CODE>), each of which matches
a comma-separated list of zero or more template parameters. The ellipsis
notation can further be used in several ways within the template definition
to indicate argument lists and derived type lists, among other things.
Hence, a single variadic template can represent an open-ended set of templates
that differ in the number of template parameters they accept.</P>
