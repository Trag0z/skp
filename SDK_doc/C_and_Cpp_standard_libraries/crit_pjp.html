<P>Dinkumware, Ltd. and P.J. Plauger (&quot;Licensor&quot;) retain exclusive
ownership of this Product. It is licensed to you (&quot;Licensee&quot;) in
accordance with the terms specifically stated in this Notice. If you have
obtained this Product from a third party or under a special license from
Dinkumware, Ltd., additional restrictions may also apply. You
must otherwise treat the Product the same as other copyrighted
material, such as a book or recording. You may also exercise
certain rights particular to computer software under copyright law.
In particular:</P>

<UL>
<LI>You may use the Library portion of the Product (if present)
to compile and link with C/C++ code to produce executable files.</LI>

license fee to Licensor.</LI>

<LI>You may make one or more backup copies of the Product for
archival purposes.</LI>

<P>This copy of the Product is licensed for use by a limited number of
developers, which is specified as part of the packaging for this
Product. A license for up to ten users, for example, limits to ten
the number of developers reasonably able to use the Product at any
instant of time. Thus, ten is the maximum number of <B>possible</B>
concurrent users, not the number of <B>actual</B> concurrent users. A
single-user license is for use by just one developer.</P>

<P>Anyone who accesses this software has a moral responsibility not to
aid or abet illegal copying by others. Licensor recognizes that the
machine-readable format of the Product makes it particularly
conducive to sharing within multi-user systems and across networks.
Such use is permitted only so long as Licensee does not exceed the
maximum number of possible concurrent users and takes reasonable
precautions to protect the Product against unauthorized copying and
against public access. In particular, please note that the ability
to <B>access</B> this copy does not imply permission to <B>use</B>
it or to <B>copy</B> it.
Please note also that Licensor has expended considerable
professional effort in the production of this Product, and continues
to do so to keep it current.</P>

<P>Licensor warrants that the Product as shipped performs substantially
in accordance with its documented purpose, and that the medium on
which the Product is provided is free from defects in material and
workmanship. To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties
on the Product are limited to 90 days.</P>

<P>Licensor's entire liability under this warranty shall be, at
Licensor's option, either to refund the license fee paid by
Licensee or to replace the medium on which the Product is provided.
This is also Licensee's exclusive remedy. To qualify for this
remedy, Licensee must demonstrate satisfactory proof of purchase to
Licensor and return the Product in reasonably good condition to
Licensor.</P>

<P>LICENSOR OTHERWISE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE
SUITABILITY OF THIS PRODUCT, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE AS A
RESULT OF USING THIS PRODUCT, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES.</P>

<P>By using this Product, you agree to abide by the intellectual
property laws and all other applicable laws of the USA, and the
