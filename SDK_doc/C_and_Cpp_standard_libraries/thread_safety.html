<H1><A NAME="Thread_Safety"></A>Thread Safety</H1><HR>

<P>The C++ Standard says nothing about multithreaded environments;
nevertheless most nontrivial operating systems support some form
of threading. In such an environment, it is important to know
what operations are safe on data that is shared between two
or more threads, what operations are unsafe, and what you can
do to make unsafe operations safe.</P>

<P>The Dinkum C++11 Libraries can be built either as
multithreaded or single-threaded. The former is, of course,
the most robust; but the latter can be smaller and faster
in an environment where thread safety is never an issue,
because all threading code is omitted.
The setup scripts that select the active library, and
optionally build it, have the options <B><CODE>MT</CODE></B>,
to select a multithreaded library, and <B><CODE>NO_MT</CODE></B>,
to select a single-threaded library. Multithreaded is the
usual default.</P>

<P>The following descriptions apply only to multithreaded
libraries.</P>

<H2>Standard C Input/Output</H2>

<P>In the Standard C Library, all input/output is mediated
by objects of type
<CODE><B><A HREF="stdio.html#FILE">FILE</A></B></CODE>. Atomic
operations on these objects, such as calls to
<CODE><A HREF="stdio.html#getc">getc</A></CODE> and
<CODE><A HREF="stdio.html#putc">putc</A></CODE>,
are protected against simultaneous access from different threads.
Thus, you can safely share <CODE>FILE</CODE> objects across
threads without worrying about loss of integrity. But you
might not like the way file accesses interleave, so you
typically need additional thread locks at the appropriate
level of granularity.</P>

<P>If you want changes to the file to be reflected after
each atomic write, you must change the definition of the
macro <CODE><B>_FILE_OP_LOCKS</B></CODE> from <CODE>0</CODE>
to <CODE>1</CODE> in all copies of the internal header
<CODE>&lt;yvals.h&gt;</CODE>, then rebuild the libraries.
Since this disables quite a bit of file buffering, your
program may well run slower. And you might still not
like the way the atomic writes interleave; but you do
have tighter control over file modifications with this
option.</P>

<H2>Standard C++ Input/Output</H2>

<P>In the Standard C++ Library, all input/output is mediated
by <B><A NAME="iostream_object"></A>iosrteam objects</B> of template types
<CODE><A HREF="istream.html#basic_istream">basic_istream</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="istream.html#basic_iostream">basic_iostream</A></CODE>, and
<CODE><A HREF="ostream.html#basic_ostream">basic_ostream</A></CODE>.
Atomic operations on these objects, such as extractions and insertions,
are protected against simultaneous access from different threads.
They are also synchronized with operations directly on
the <CODE>FILE</CODE> object that underlies each iostream object.
(In this implementation
there is no need to call the iostream member function
<CODE><A HREF="ios.html#ios_base__sync_with_stdio">sync_with_stdio</A></CODE>
to ensure such synchronization, nor is there any performance benefit
in disabling it.)
Thus, you can safely share iostream objects across
threads without worrying about loss of integrity. But once again you
might not like the way file accesses interleave, so you
typically need additional thread locks at the appropriate
level of granularity.</P>

<P>If you want changes to the file to be reflected after
each atomic write, you must change the definition of the
macro <CODE><B>_IOSTREAM_OP_LOCKS</B></CODE> from <CODE>0</CODE>
to <CODE>1</CODE> in all copies of the internal header
<CODE>&lt;yvals.h&gt;</CODE>, then rebuild the libraries.
Since this disables quite a bit of file buffering, your
program may well run slower. And you might still not
like the way the atomic writes interleave; but you do
have tighter control over file modifications with this
option.</P>

<H2>Containers</H2>

<P>For the <B><A NAME="container_objects"></A>container objects</B>
defined in the Standard C++ Library, such as
<B><A HREF="lib_cont.html">STL Containers</A></B>
and objects of template class
<CODE><A HREF="string2.html#basic_string">basic_string</A></CODE>,
this implementation
follows the widely adopted practices spelled out for
<A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html">SGI STL</A>:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Multiple threads can safely read the same container object.
(There are no unprotected mutable subobjects within a container
object.)</LI>

<LI>Two threads can safely manipulate different container objects
of the same type. (There are no unprotected shared static objects
within a container type.)</LI>

<LI>You must protect against simultaneous access to a container
object if at least one thread is modifying the object. (The
obvious synchronization primitives, such as those in the Dinkum
Threads Library, will not be subverted by the container object.)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Thus, no attempt is made to ensure that atomic operations
on container objects are thread safe; but it is easy enough
to make shared container objects that are thread safe
at the appropriate level of granularity.</P>
